This repo contains my learning, real-world projects and code.

Hello, everyone! My name is Siarhey(or Sergius). I like Data Science, computer hardware (I builded several PC's, and not only for myself, but for others too), also interested in ecology (especialy waste managment and its regulation) and digitalization of legislation process (I've got PhD in Law and Bachelor degree in Computer Science).

This repo contains some of my learning (real-life) projects and code.
