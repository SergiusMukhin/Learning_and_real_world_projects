# hello-world
First repo. Contains my learning, real-world projects and code.

Hello, everyone! My name is Siarhey(or Sergius). I like Data Science, compute hardware (I builds several PC's, and not only for myself, but for others too) and interesting in ecology (especialy waste managment and its regulation).

This repo contains some of my learning (real-life) projects and code.
